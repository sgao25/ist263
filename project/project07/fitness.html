    <h1>Fitness</h1>

    <p>Determining whether you're getting the most out of your workout can be a challenge. It's important to find the right balance between pushing yourself too hard or not hard enough. By aiming for your heart rate zone and exercising at the appropriate intensity, you can enhance the effectiveness of your workouts and improve your chances of achieving your fitness objectives.</p>

    <h2>Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Exercise</h2>
    <div class=difference>
      <div>
        <h3>Aerobic</h3>
        <p>refers to physical exercise carried out by the human body under the condition of adequate supply of oxygen.</p>
        <p>Aerobic exercise is the type of exercise that keeps heart rate at 60% to 80% of max heart rate per minute,<strong>(Max heart rate =220- age)</strong> because blood can supply enough oxygen to the heart muscle.</p>
        <p>Aerobic exercise is characterized by <strong>low intensity, rhythm, and long duration.</strong> At this time, the body's energy supply mainly comes from the <strong>aerobic metabolism of fat.</strong></p>

      </div>


      <div>
        <h3>Anaerobic</h3>
        <p>It is the exercise that muscles perform at high speed. </p>
        <p>Anaerobic exercise is mostly exercise with <strong>high load intensity and strong instant.</strong></p>
        <p>Your anaerobic heart rate zone is 80-90% of your max heart rate.</p>
        <p>When we engage in very intense sports, the body needs a lot of energy in an instant, and under normal circumstances, aerobic metabolism is not able to meet the needs of the body at this time, so <strong>sugar changes to anaerobic metabolism model </strong>in order to quickly generate large amounts of energy.</p>
