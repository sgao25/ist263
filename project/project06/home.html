<h2 class="introduction">About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Sabrina Gao. I am majoring in public relations and am interested in fashion, beauty, and entertainment fields. I am also minoring in information management and technology. </p>
<p>I was in Chattanooga, Tennessee for my high school. I was on the cross-country team for three years, and a soccer manager for 2 years. Also, because of this experience, I developed one of my hobbies: going to the gym. </p>
<p>I hope this website can help to build a basic knowledge of fitness and nutrition for people to improve their daily habits.</p>
