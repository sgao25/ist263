    <p>Whether an exercise is aerobic or not is measured by heart rate.</p>

    <h2>Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Exercise</h2>
    <h3>Aerobic</h3>
    <p>refers to physical exercise carried out by the human body under the condition of adequate supply of oxygen.</p>
    <p>Aerobic exercise <strong>(Max heart rate =220- age)</strong> is the type of exercise that keeps heart rate at 60% to 80% of max heart rate per minute, because blood can supply enough oxygen to the heart muscle.</p>
    <p>Aerobic exercise is characterized by <strong>low intensity, rhythm, and long duration.</strong> At this time, the body's energy supply mainly comes from the <strong>aerobic metabolism of fat.</strong></p>

    <h3>Anaerobic exercise</h3>
   <p>It is the exercise that muscles perform at high speed. </p>
   <p>Anaerobic exercise is mostly exercise with <strong>high load intensity and strong instant.</strong></p>
   <p>When we engage in very intense sports, the body needs a lot of energy in an instant, and under normal circumstances, aerobic metabolism is not able to meet the needs of the body at this time, so <strong>sugar changes to anaerobic metabolism model </strong>in order to quickly generate large amounts of energy.</p>
