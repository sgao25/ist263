     <h1 id="main">Sabrina Gao's Biography</h1>
     <p> 
        My name is Siyuan/ Sabrina Gao. I come from Shanghai, China. I am a public relations major and interested in fashion, beauty, and entertainment fields. I am also minoring in information management and technology. At the same time, I am considering exploring the consulting industry as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was in Chattanooga, Tennessee for my high school. It was my first time coming to America, and I was 12 years old that year. I was on the cross-country team for three years, and one fun fact is that I threw up almost every practice and every game. Also, because of this experience, I developed one of my hobbies: going to the gym. I also like watching movies and listening to music in my spare time. I love traveling and have been to more than 7 countries. I hope I can travel to Europe and experience their life in the future. France has been my dream country to travel to. 
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p> 
        I had several PR internship experience and seeking to find an internship for the 2023 summer. I hope I can get a job when I graduate from Syracuse University.
